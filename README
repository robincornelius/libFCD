libFCD is a library for controlling the Funcube pro dongle and a command
line utility for demonstrating the library. Its main goal was to use the 
FCD on a Rasperry PI. Inital work appears to be successful and the FCD
can be controlled and audio data saved. Its not clear if the PI has enough
CPU to process the data via GNU Radio or some other tools and that is work
to be done.


Building the code

So far only tested on the Raspberry Pi running Rasperian Wheezy

Requirments 

cmake
libusb-1.0
libudev
libargtable2

in the source directory, create a build folder then :-

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
  make
  make install

That installs to /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib

you may need to do
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib

if you want to install elsewhere eg /usr not /usr/local then run the cmake line as thus :-
  cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..

to find the shared libs in the /usr/local location, some distros set this up 
for you but on the RPi Radperian Wheezy it was not set.

This may also work with some hacking on windows/mac, hidapi fully supports 
linux/mac and windows, so apart from my bad code in the lib, it 
should work.

A large chunk of header files, structs and basic function call layout 
of the lib was taken directly from the qthid by Alexandru Csete. Which
saved me a bunch of work and gave me a nice starting point.

hidapi was downloaded from http://www.signal11.us/oss/hidapi/ and is avaiable

The only change I have made to this folder is to add a CMakeLists.txt file as
I am using cmake for the entire build process
